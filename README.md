<p align="center">This mod adds a new block, the Visual Effects Generator</p>

![This is an overview over the different blockstates of the VFX Generator](https://i.imgur.com/qFnL8DA.png)

<p align="center">This block enables you to generate an array of visual effects using it's GUI, which the block then generates in a customizable area around it in the world.</p>
&nbsp
<p align="center">Currently, you can only generate particles, but more effects are planned. You can also only choose from a few predefined shapes/textures, however we are also planning to add a way to add your own textures to enable you to create any particle or visual effect you want in the future.</p>
