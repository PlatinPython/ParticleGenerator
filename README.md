<p align="center">Want to build a menacing-looking Volcano without running the risk of burning all your surroundings, including yourself? Want to build a confetti cannon but don't have any confetti lying around? Do have some spare end rods, redstone blocks, stone and some glass though? Well, just craft yourself the new VFX Generator!</p>

### <p align="center">This mod adds a new block, the <b>Visual Effects Generator</b></p>

![This is an overview over the different blockstates of the VFX Generator](https://i.imgur.com/qFnL8DA.png)

<p align="center">This block enables you to generate an array of visual effects using it's GUI, which the block then generates in a customizable area around it in the world.</p>
&nbsp
<p align="center">Currently, you can only generate particles, but more effects are planned. You can also only choose from a few predefined shapes/textures, however we are also planning to add a way to add your own textures to enable you to create any particle or visual effect you want in the future.</p>
